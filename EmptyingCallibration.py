#Modeled is the slope of the line at certain points.

#model is the  the imitation of an original.


# model - a representation of the real world.
#   requites some data about the real world.
#Analytical model: equation or function tht representes (best fits) the data.
#Linear, polynomial, exponention, sinusoidal, logarithmic, hyperbolic, radical.

#Only waorks for well behaved systems (simple systems). Not a wholle lot of interactions taht will introduce errors.non-chaotic.
#often use calculus to find the equations.
#physical Models
#   small scale physical thing (you can touch it)
#can be more complex
# numerical models
#Usually computer model because there are a lot of calculations. (algabreac calculations)
#usually break the system into smaller parts that interact with each other.
#the coputer is used to keep trach of all the interactions.
# We'll focus on things that chagne over time.
# we'll focus on finite difference models.
